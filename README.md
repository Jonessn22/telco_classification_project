## 1. Project Overview
### A. Project Description
Telco Communications is a fictional telecommunications company looking to reduce customer churn (aka customer attrition, aka customers leaving Telco for competitors). I will be using customer data and machine learning methodologies to determine what is driving customer churn and, with that information, providing management (<i>non-data scientists</i>) with recommendations for reducing customer churn.
### B. Business Goals
Management already knows that customers on month to month payment plans are churning at higher rates but removing the month to month payment option is not feasible at this time. The goal is to look at the results from the machine learning model and determine which of our existing customers are a high risk for churning. I will then provide recommendations on how we can incentivize these customers to remain with Telco, as the cost of retaining an existing customer is much less than the cost of acquiring a new one.
### C. Deliverables
- final_project_report.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook for project presentation walkthrough)
- draft_project_report.ipynb (working Jupyter Notebook)
- predictions.csv (churn predictions from best performing model, run on X_test)
- acquire.py and prepapre.py (modules containing data acquisition and preparation functions, respectively)
